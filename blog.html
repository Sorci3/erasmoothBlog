													<h3>Snow in Finland</h3>
													<p>Author : Le Pottier Mathias <br> Date : 19/01/2025</p>
													Before we start, a bit of background :<br>
													Finland is nordic country wich is famous for its winter landscapes and the snow plays a crucial role in many of them. Due to the climate, snow cover Finland for a long period (it can be from november to april) and so much snow influence the culture, life style and activities of Finnish. <br>
													During the same period the daylight isn’t long (10am to 3pm) and even if the combination of the snow, the darkness and potential aurora borealis create a magical ambiance, the lack of sunlight affect the moral of everyone in a bad way.
													During winter, the average temperature is -15°C (even if, for the moment it’s warmer for us, more between -5°C and 4°C) so there is ice everywhere and it’s very slippy. The most of us are well equipped for the winter climate with technical footwear and thermal clothing but when there is wind you get cold very quickly.
													<br><img src="images/article/IMG20250108151845 - .jpg" alt=""/><br>
													Now, our main subject :<br>
													When we first arrive, we tried throwing snowballs at each other as any normal human would have done, the problem was that the snow was a little bit different than in France (when there is snow of course…), the snow was as hard as ice. It was so cold when we arrive that the snow was just pieces of ice… Our plan for a snowball fight has been compromised.
													Later, some of us managed to make a snowman (so you can made snowman even with icy snow, good to know I guess…), but this isn’t all, in Finland, snow means lots of activities like skiing, snowboarding or even snowmobile safaris. Of course there is also the famous activity where you go to the sauna and there you plunge into the water of a frozen lake.
													However, recent climate change is having an impact on snowfall in Finland. Winters are becoming milder, especially in the south, which is a major concern for the whole country.

													<h3>The lights of the night</h3>
													<p>Author : Herbreteau Mathis <br> Date : 20/01/2025</p>
													A cool thing to compare with your home country when you go to Finland, and you plan to live there 
													is the duration of the day. For example, in France, in January the average day duration is around 
													8 or 9 hours with a sunrise at around 8am and a sunset at around 5pm. These numbers change 
													throughout the year and are very different in each country. Here in Finland, in early January the 
													average day duration is 5 hours with a sunrise at around 10am and a sunset at around 3pm. It can 
													be very disturbing at first to go out at 3pm to visit the city and unfortunately its already the 
													night and you need to navigate in the city with lampposts light.
													<br>
													<br>
													When we talk about lamppost in Finland, it is not the most ecological invention they made, because 
													they just stay lighten up all the night. The main point to this is to protect the citizens, because 
													at night, the risks for drivers and pedestrians are much higher. With all the ice and the snow, people 
													need to see where they are walking or driving because the ground is very slippery, and it is verry easy 
													to fall. And as French people, we have already almost fallen multiple times in broad daylight, so we 
													don’t dislike having a little light at night. 
													<br>
													<img src="images/uniquethings/Lampadaires.jpg" alt=""/>
													<h4>1. Here is an exemple of the city at night.</h4>
													<br>
													The real problem with this is the light pollution. As you may know, Finland is known for its northern lights,
													 and unfortunately, if there is too much light, it is very hard if not impossible to see them. It also ruins 
													 the beauty of the night sky and can disrupt animals, insect and humans at night. Because yes, the use of 
													 artificial lights at night, can have an impact on the human circadian cycle. If you are exposed to too much 
													 light during the evening it can interfere with the body’s natural production of melatonin, the hormone that 
													 regulates sleep. This can make it harder to fall asleep, reduce sleep quality, and lead to fatigue during the 
													 day. Our first nights there were quite short, and it was really hard to sleep since thy don’t have blinds in 
													 Finland, they only have curtains. But we got used to it and everything is fine now !

													<h3>How to beat the cold</h3>
													<p>Author : Pasquier Samuel <br> Date : 20/01/2025</p>
													I am of course not telling you anything new if I tell you if it can be very cold in Finland. 
													At the time I’m writing this article, we didn’t have a temperature inferior to minus 16 degree Celsius, but we know from the former Erasmus from ESAIP that temperatures equal to minus 36 degrees are possible. 
													<br>
													<br>
													The problem we have is that we need to survive that. 
													We have to take inspiration from the Finnish people themselves: if you can stay inside, stay inside. 
													But if you need to go outside, the best way is to stack layer up, at least three: the first layer, close to the body, must be breathable, because you need to put the sweat away. 
													Why? Because if the sweat builds up and you stop generating heat from your body, like when you stop moving and it’s cold enough outside, ice can form and hurt you by attaching to your body. 
													For this layer you need something like thermal underwear or a polyester T-shirt without cotton. The second layer needs to be very hot to keep you warm and retain your body heat. You can wear something like a pullover, a fleece jacket or a long sleeve heavy duty shirt. 
													And finally for the outer layer need to protect you against the element, like the snow, the rain or the wind. 
													This is the base principle for all parts of your body, I’ve shown you the clothes you can use for the upper part of your body.
													<br>
													<br>
													It’s the same thing for the other parts of your body: for your legs, you wear thermal underwear then any sort of pants like joggings, blue jeans or velvet pants. 
													For your feet, you must double your socks and then use heavy duty shoes like boots. If there is ice outside, you can use cleats to avoid falling to your death on the ice. 
													The last thing you need to tackle before going outside is the extremity of your body like your hand or your head. For the hand, you can double your glove or use mitten. 
													Finally, for your head, use a hood, a beanie or even a neck warmer.

												<h3>Small details that make Finland unique</h3>
												<p>Author: Martinat Julien <br> Date: 20/01/2025</p>
											
												<strong>Bull Bars on Cars</strong>
												<p>At the front of many cars, I noticed something at the front that is unusual. These are not just aesthetic features or engine heaters but protections, sometimes referred to as bull bars, but it is for daily life cars. They also have some headlights attached to it. They are designed to shield vehicles from impacts, particularly collisions with wildlife animals.</p>

												<strong>Respect for Pedestrians</strong>
												<p>Crossing a pedestrian walkway in Finland is a nice experience for many visitors. Finnish drivers are very polite and stop quickly when they see someone who wants to cross the road. Respect for pedestrians is an important part of Finnish culture.</p>
												<div style="text-align: center;">

												<br>
										
												<strong>No Shutters, Only Blinds</strong>
												<p>For people used to windows with shutters, it can feel strange that there are none in Finland compared to France. Finnish homes usually have light blinds, but they don’t completely block the light. This is because people in Finland like to use as much natural light as possible since it is very important in this country that has long and dark winters.</p>
												<div style="text-align: center;">
													<img src="images/uniquethings/volets.png" alt="Window with blinds" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
												</div>
												<br>
										
												<strong>Bottle Deposit System</strong>
												<p>Whenever you pay a plastic bottle or can, there is a fee on it added on your bill depending on what you’ve bought. Finland has a recycling system where every bottle or can comes with a deposit: €0.40 for a bottle and €0.15 for a can. This system encourages recycling and makes Finland a leader in waste management. After recycling the bottles or cans at the machine near a mall, you can use the coupons given by the machine to buy new things in the mall.</p>

												<p style="margin: 0;">Since Urbex (Urban exploration) is one of my biggest passions, I wanted to share a place I found even before arriving at Seinäjoki. All I know is that this place was an educational institution named Sedu, it has been abandoned between 2018 and 2022 from what I can say. This place is near the Seinäjoki Hospital and took me nearly 4 hours to explore entirely. What I found here was mind-blowing: 2 bunkers, a swimming pool, a gymnasium, classrooms, an air ventilation system, a cafeteria, 2 amphitheaters, a dental room with a chair, student apartments, a server room, and much more …</p>

												<h3>Clue me in 1st edition</h3>
												<p>Author: Bonneau Axel <br> Date: 21/01/2025</p>
												<p>
													Welcome to the first edition of “Clue Me In.”
												    Your objective: Find the word or theme I’ll be talking about today in the shortest time possible. 
												    Let’s get 
													started!
												</p>
												<p>
													I’m describing a medium-sized, brown animal measuring around 65 to 85 centimeters.
													It is an omnivore that feeds on worms, seeds, and insects. This animal is a bird with a long,
													tapering tail and lives quite close to human civilization. It is typically found near rural areas and villages.
												</p>
												<p>
													Here’s your final hint: during mating season, 
													this bird gathers a group of females (a “harem”) and performs elaborate rituals to seduce them. 
													These rituals involve loud crowing and dramatic wing-flapping displays.
												</p>
												<p>
													The pheasant is primarily an Eurasian bird but originates from China. It was introduced to Central Europe and Finland on a massive scale (more on that later).
													The pheasant holds different meanings in various cultures. In China, this bird symbolizes good fortune and beauty. In European mythology, it is often associated with fertility. For Native Americans, the pheasant is an honored creature, representing harmony with nature.
													Today, pheasants are primarily bred for hunting. In the United Kingdom alone, around 47 million pheasants are released from captivity each year for this purpose. Finland follows a similar practice.
												</p>
												<p>
													Hunting pheasants in Finland is relatively easy, as only three conditions must be met:
												</p>
												<ul>
													<li>You need a Finnish hunting card, which can be obtained by passing a €20 hunting test.</li>
													<li>You must have the landowner’s permission to hunt on their property.</li>
													<li>You need the proper license to possess a firearm.</li>
												</ul>
												<p>
													Once these requirements are fulfilled, you can legally hunt!
													As I mentioned earlier, pheasants are not native to Finland. They were introduced at the beginning of the 20th century, and their current population density is approximately 0.1 pairs per square kilometer. Interestingly, pheasants need to be fed by humans during Finland’s cold winters.
													Today, pheasants are among the most popular game birds in Finland, alongside other birds.

												<h3>Sauna</h3>
												<p>Author: Le Pottier Mathias <br> Date: 15/02/2025</p>
												<p>The sauna is one of the biggest activities in Finland, much more than just a place to relax it is a big monument of the Finnish culture. Finnish people consider this activity to be essential to a person's well-being. With a population of 5.5 million and over 3 million saunas, Finland is really the land of the sauna.</p>
												<p>The history of the sauna goes back over 2000 years. The first inhabitants of Finland built wooden huts called savusaunas. These huts were heated by a fireplace in the centre of the building. However, these huts had several roles and were used for giving birth (due to the sterility of the room), for fermenting certain foods or for certain religious acts. Over the centuries, sauna construction and heating techniques have evolved by, nowadays electric saunas are available for better temperature control.</p>
												<p>How does it work? Before entering in the sauna people take a shower then stones or coal are heated to a high temperature, then water is poured over them to create a cloud of steam that gradually heats the room to between 80°C and 110°C. It is highly recommended by regulars to bring a water bottle to drink after a session. In fact, during a session you sweat a lot, so you dehydrate quickly.</p>
												<p>Why take a sauna? Saunas have many benefits for the human body like
													<ul>
														<li>relax muscles</li>
														<li>release stress</li>
														<li>improve blood circulation</li>
														<li>prevent chronic illness</li>
														<li>boost the immune system</li>
														<li>eliminates toxins</li>
													</ul>
												</p>

												<p>Our experience: 
													We tested a rather special sauna, the goal of this sauna was to make a session at 90°C and immediately after we had to go in an ice lake with water at 0°C. The first time was hard because of the thermal shock, after few second in the ice lake our limbs were numb and we could no longer feel certain parts of the body. We had to do it 3 times to start find it less hard. Some of the regular was amused to saw us testing it for the first time, they give us some advice like “don’t put your arms in the water”.</p>

												<p>In Finland, the sauna is much more than just a tradition - it's a monument to their culture.</p>

												<h3>The Finnish everyman's rights:</h3>
												<p>Author: Pasquier Samuel <br> Date: 15/02/2025</p>
												<p>Like and many other countries, Finland as a beautiful and wild countryside, its beautiful in the winter and in all the other season. And like every other country, people love to wander it at all times of the year. The Finnish people are very attached to it, they call it the “Jokaisenoikeudet” or the “Everyman’Right”</p>
												<p>You can do a lot of things in the public and wild area of Finland: You can explore the numerous National Park (more than 40) with trail route, Cleary marked with campsite and lean in with campfire, every know and then. Another big aspect of this incredible freedom is that you can forage wild foods: Due to the harsh conditions of Finland, especially around the arctic circle that some of these are even considered superfood. You can harvest multiple plant, mushroom and berries like yellow Chanterelles, cloudberries and even the famous wild blueberries. During youre hike, you can also see wild animals, like elk, wolf, lynx, fox and bear that you can encounter, take photo of from a safe distance and without disturbing them. With the rule of Finland, you can also roam private land if you keep clear of home and other living place by about 100 meters, but you are free to do everything else. In all these places, you can do more than just hiking, you can swim, use a bike, do canoe or cross-country skiing and even line and ice fishing if you have the good permit.</p>

												<img src="images/article/EverymanRight1.png" width="506px" height="295px">

												<p>But with every right, there are responsibilities: you have to respect the nature, because it's fragile and there are areas forbidden from visit to protect the fauna and flora. Even if you can pick berries and other, you have to be reasonable about it, only pick up what you can eat and you can’t take wood, especially by cutting trees. But the most important rule of them all is that you cannot leave traces behind you, there is no tolerance when you are littering and noise. When you’re hiking leave no rubbish and try to avoid disturbing rocks where you go to protect fragile fauna and flora. You should always stay on the path to protect yourself and the nature around you. Ideally, when you are hiking you should only leave footstep behind you.</p>

												<p>In Finland, the EveryMan Right is a cornerstone of the hiking culture</p>

												<h3>Cost of Living in Finland</h3>
												<p>Author: Martinat Julien <br> Date: 16/02/2025</p>
										
												<p>Okay let’s talk a bit about money now.</p>
										
												<p>As a member of the northern countries, we can expect Finland to have a very high living cost. Therefore, this is not really true and we will discuss this.</p>
										
												<p>When comparing the cost of life in France and in Finland, on paper there is not a great difference. In fact, the average cost of living in Finland is actually 2% under the one in France. Is it true? Yes and no at the same time.<br>
												To be more specific, the differences depend on what we are talking about.<br>
												So, let’s browse through different categories to check the variations between the cost of things in France and in Finland.</p>
										
												<strong>Food and Drinks</strong>
												<p>In the supermarkets the cost of food is on average the same as in France except for specific products. For example, some fruits can be less expensive in Finland like the blueberries, some are at the same price like the bananas and some are more costly like oranges (the price depends also of the seasons naturally).<br>
												Cheese is also more expensive here (and less choice) as they don't really produce their own and import from other European countries.</p>
										
												<p>Meat, fish and eggs are about the same price as well as ice cream (yes, they have a good variety). However, the treats and the milk are less expensive and this is certainly due to the Finnish people’s habit to consume these all the time.<br>
												For the drinks they are globally more expensive and this even more true for alcohol drinks.</p>
										
												<strong>Restaurants</strong>
												<p>Also, the restaurants are, on average, a bit more expensive here and fast-foods like McDonald or Burger King offer certainly lower prices but with less quantities too so, in the end, the price is about the same as in France. The restaurants at university offer, therefore, very attractive prices: 2,95€ for lunch.</p>
										
												<strong>Transport and Activities</strong>
												<p>On the aspect of transport, here also it is varied. City buses are either free, or more expensive than in France (2,10 € for one ticket), car fuel is more expensive (1,80 €/L here in Seinäjoki) but the trains are really cheap (even more for students: 5-7€ for 150km).</p>
										
												<p>Concerning activities, the cinema is very expensive (between 11€ and 15€) but the museums we did were very cheap (6€ for three museums). Skiing, as well as all winter activities, is pretty attractive and even more with the student discount.</p>
										
												<strong>Conclusion</strong>
												<p>To conclude, contrary to what we might think, the cost of living in Finland is not especially higher than in France. Some things are more expensive, others less, there are differences but overall, it is about the same.</p>

													<h3>Arctic wildlife</h3>
													<p>Author: Herbreteau Mathis <br> Date: 17/02/2025</p>
													<p>
													Finland is a vast country, and with its beautiful landscapes, it also comes with a very 
													rich wildlife that makes it even more incredible. While you can find elks and raindeer’s almost
													everywhere in Finland, there are animals that are much more difficult to find. The main
													reason for that is that they live mostly in the arctic circle that is high in Finland.
													<br>

													<h4>1. A Raindeer that we had the chance to see in Lapland.</h4>

													<br>
													The most difficult to see are the famous brown bears, it is said that you may have 
													encountered one even though you didn’t see any, and if you see one, you are really lucky
													because the bear already knew since a long time that you were there. They don't like to
													be seen and are masters of the art of going unnoticed. 
													<br>
													Along the brown bear, animal like wolves, wolverines and lynxes are hard to spot. 
													Some don’t like to come near inhabited areas, and others are too few and hide so 
													well that you won’t be able to see them. 
													<br>
													In winter, you could walk past one of the many animals that live in Lapland, and you
													wouldn't even notice it. In fact, these animals don't need to hide because they blend
													so easily into the background. Arctic foxes or stoats, with their white fur, are hardly
													noticeable when they move in the snow.

													<br>
													Since we couldn’t see one of these magnificent creatures in the wilderness during our 
													trip to Lapland, we decided to visit the northernmost Zoo in the World, the Ranua WildLife
													Park, in Ranua. There, we were able to see most of the animals I mentioned at the start of
													the article. The park offers a simple but wonderful walk between the owls, the wolve, the 
													wild boars and a lot of other animals. Unfortunately, the stars of the park, the polar bears 
													weren’t there when we visited it, their enclosure was being rebuilt so we couldn’t see them.
													
													<br>
													We still had a good time visiting it and we had the chance to se other animals such as wolverines, 
													lynxes, foxes and many others. And, of course, we ended the visit with a visit to the souvenir shop, 
													where we spent much more than we had planned.

													<h3>What is wrong with milk in Finland?</h3>
													<p>Author: Axel Bonneau <br> Date: 22/02/2025</p>
												<p>
													That is indeed quite an odd question and if you never went to Finland, you might not
													even understand what is this all about. 
													<br>
													The first time we went groceries shopping was pretty similar to France and there was mostly
													the same product. Until we saw the milk(dairy) section which was huge. There were dozens of
													different brands of milk all having their own different kind of milk and none of them actually
													looked like the one we would actually buy in France… But Then 2 or 3 week later we finally
													found it: The one and only “Semi skimmed milk” the exact one that we had in France and
													the same taste. Now that you have some context, what is up with Finnish people and dairy? 
													<br>
													First of all, Finns (Finns are people living in Finland) love milk, to the point that they
													are the country where the most wilk is consumed per person for an average of 130 litres of
													milk per years. For reference, a cow in 1 years produce on average 7570 litres if milk meaning
													that one cow produce milk for only 58 Finns and that you would need 96 275 cows just to answer 
													the need of milk of Finns.
													<br>
													Ill just add that they also eat an average of 0.6 liter of yogurt a day and 73g of cheese…
													<br>
													But why is milk so important in Finland? It’s as simple as it gets. Finland is quite the cold country
													where crops have a hard time to grow. But crops such as hay and potatoes can grow everywhere 
													(even in Lapland) ant those crops were an excellent source of food for cows… And as you might know (I hope)
													cows produce milk. And so, milk in most places was a easy to access product which gave you protein and 
													calories intake for the day.
													
													<br>
													What’s funny about Finns and milk is that 17% of people are lactose intolerant and that genetic trait is actually hereditary.
													So when we arrive in Finland there is a word we learn almost instantly:”laktosiiton” which means lactose intolerance.
													We had to learn that specific word because all products have a non-lactose version, and you can be “trapped” quite easily
													<br>
													Milk is a tradition in Finland and I think even if all Finns where lactose intolerant they would still find a way to drink milk 
													and if you want to make Finnish friends I think you could, honestly just give them a glass of milk.

													<h3>Our courses</h3>
													<p>Author: Le Pottier Mathias <br> Date: 12/03/2025</p>
												
													<p>Hello! Today I will write about our different courses.</p> 
													
													<p>To begin we are studying at SeAMK (Seinäjoki university of applied science) which is a private university in Seinäjoki. The university offers a wide range of disciplines, including medicine, automation (us), the food industry, the cultural sector, marketing and catering.</p>
													
													<p>Our first course was Professional English, it is basically English with a focus on industry vocab. The professor used Moodle a lot (a lot more than ESAIP) because we made every activities on it. The course was very interactive between students due to the activities being for the majority group activities.</p>
													
													<p>Our second course was intercultural communication, it had a lot of similarities with intercultural culture that we have at ESAIP. We used to talk a lot about the Finnish culture (and their love for coffee). Our exam was to write about the geographic effect on culture.</p>
													
													<p>The next one is Project Work, the name of the course has nothing in common with the actual course. In fact, we are studying automation with Siemens application. This is also the course that give us the most of credit point.</p>
													
													<p>We also have C++ programming, this course teaches us how to make an application in C++.</p>
													
													<p>Another one is Robotics, we are studying industrial robots (how they work, what are their specification, …), we also simulate them because in the second part of the course we are going in a laboratory to work with a real industrial robot.</p>
													
													<p>After, we have Embedded System where we are studying ESP32 and how to make little embedded systems with different component like LED, button, …</p>
													
													<p>>One of the last is Production Management, in that course we are studying how to manage the production in an industry. We learn about the economic aspect but also about technology aspect.</p>
													
													<p>And last but not least, we have Introduction TO AI. This is the most complicated course that we have because of the complexity of the math behind. We are learning about the different math concept and how to implement them in python.</p>
													
													<p>Something that surprise us in Finnish university is that courses are 1h45 because they think that a 15 minutes break in the middle is important. I like that fact because being concentrated for 1h30 straight is hard, I find myself more focus in the courses thanks to the break.</p>

												<h3>Photo and Video Creation in Finland:</h3>
												<p>Author: Pasquier Samuel <br> Date: 12/03/2025</p>
												<p>For this trip to Finland, I’ve brought the following equipment: A Sony Nex 5n camera with an 18-55mm lens, I use my phone for some photo, and I use a gimbal for video production to have stabilized footage and even movement in my production. One of the most important aspects of video production is to have a good sound, and for that purpose I have a shotgun mic and a tie clip mic to have crisp vocal for interview and hearing people talking. Finally, I also have a tripod and a special optical grade flashlight to avoid rolling shutter black strip when taking photo in dark place. </p>

												<p>Now I can give some general-purpose advice when you’re going to do a photo trip in Finland. As you may know, Finland is a cold country, and this will affect your battery life and can make your device inoperable, so keep some spare with you. Try to avoid snow on your equipment to prevent water damage and lastly if it’s cold outside, when you are bringing your camera inside where it’s warmer, put it in a zip bag to prevent condensation outside and inside the body and the lens, and let it climb in temperature slowly to prevent damage to it. That’s about it for the tips to prevent damage to your equipment, other than that there isn’t much advice I can give about general photography in Finland. Snow is very white and reflective, and you can easily have an overexposed image, and you can use a ND or polarizing filter to negate this. But from my experience, it isn’t necessary as the shorter day and the low altitude of the sun greatly reduces light.</p>

												<p>Finally, I will give you some advice on how to take the best Northern Light picture: First you need a good spot, ideally with as little as artificial light as possible and the closest to the north you are, the better. Secondly, you need the good time, with an app you can track the probability to see an aurora during the following’s hour, but you also need a clear sky and if the moon is less bright, it’s also good. You need the put your camera on a stable place, a tripod is the best thing, but you can also wedge it, so it doesn’t move. Lastly you need to adjust some setting, following the rule of the exposure triangle, you need to open the aperture as much as possible and have a long exposure time to capture the faint light and a greater depth of view, but you need to lower ISO, so you don’t have a white image. Put your camera on the tripod point at the northern light, wait 10 to 20 second and you have a beautiful picture of an Aurora Borealis.</p>

												<h3>Lakes in Finland:</h3>
												<p>Author: Herbreteau Mathis <br> Date: 13/03/2025</p>
												<p>Finland is known as the Land of a thousand lakes but in reality, it is a lot more than that. Finland has, in fact, more than one-hundred and eighty thousand lakes in total all around its country. While lakes are a huge part of the landscapes in Finland, they are also important in Finnish culture. </p>

												<p>The main region where we can find lakes in Finland is the Lakeland, situated in the central eastern Finland. In fact, there are more than fifty-five thousand lakes only in this region. They define a lake as a “body of standing water larger than five hundred meters square” still they are so many. </p>
												
												<p>They were mainly created when the ancient glaciers melted, several thousand years ago. Their abundance led to lakes being a part of the Finnish culture, where people like to live next to lakes for their calmness and to relieve the stress of the city. Having a lot of lakes also allows Finnish people to go ice fishing, ice skating and a lot of other activities.  In the summer, Finnish people often go on vacations in a small cottage near a lake, to reconnect with nature. </p>

												<p>We had the opportunity to go on an ice fishing trip organised by the SAMO (student union of our university, SeAMK), but unfortunately it overlapped with some of our courses so we couldn’t go experience this part of Finnish culture.</p>

												<p>The largest and most probably most popular lake in Finland is the Saimaa Lake. One one side, it is the largest lake of Finland (approximately 4,279 kilometres square) but also the fourth largest natural freshwater lake in whole Europe. But on the other side, it is also the most touristic lake of the country.  You can do a lot of activities there, like some cruises when the lake is not frozen. There is plenty to see, with its 120 blue lakes and its almost fourteen thousand islands. And if you’d like to see more wildlife, the lake is also the home of the Saimaa salmon and the Saimaa seal.</p>

												<h4>1. Us walking on the frozen lake of Seinajoki</h4>
												<p class = "credit">by: Martinat Julien, Seinajoki</p>

												<p>During our trips, we didn’t have the chance to go to this sort of lakes, instead we travelled by foot to a lake that is a couple of kilometres away from our university. When it was a bit colder, in January and early February, the lake was completely frozen, and we experienced walking on ice for the very first time. The most difficult part was figuring out where we could walk without any risk, but with the help of locals, and by following previous footsteps, all went well. We really enjoyed this, and Finnish lakes are for sure always beautiful and enjoyable. </p>

												<h3>The Finnish Biggest Tech Companies</h3>
												<p>Author: Martinat Julien <br> Date: 14/03/2025</p>
											
												<strong>Nokia</strong>
												<p>Founded in 1865 in Finland, Nokia initially operated as a paper manufacturer before diversifying into cables, electronics, and eventually telecommunications. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nokia was the global leader in mobile phones, with iconic models like the Nokia 3310 and the N-series.</p>
												<p>At its peak in 2007, Nokia held approximately 40% of the global mobile phone market. However, the rise of smartphones and the dominance of Apple and Android led to its decline. In 2013, Microsoft acquired Nokia’s mobile division and attempted a comeback with the Lumia series under Windows Phone, but it failed.</p>
												<p>Since then, Nokia has refocused on telecommunications infrastructure, becoming a major player in 4G and 5G networks, competing with Ericsson and Huawei. By 2023, Nokia generated over €24 billion in revenue and employed around 86,000 people worldwide.</p>
											
												<strong>Supercell</strong>
												<p>Founded in 2010 in Helsinki, Supercell is a mobile gaming studio known for its "free-to-play" model with in-game microtransactions. Its first major hit was Clash of Clans (2012), a real-time strategy game where players build villages, train armies, and battle opponents.</p>
												<p>Supercell’s other successful games include:</p>
												<p>
													<li>Brawl Stars (2018) – A competitive game combining action and Battle Royale.</li>
													<li>Clash Royale (2016) – A strategic card game set in the Clash of Clans universe.</li>
													<li>Clash of Clans (2012) – A classic real-time strategy game focused on base building and battles.</li>
												</p>
												<p>Supercell generates billions in revenue each year, with Clash of Clans and Clash Royale each surpassing one billion downloads. In 2016, Chinese tech giant Tencent acquired an 84% stake in Supercell for $8.6 billion.</p>
											
												<strong>Rovio Entertainment</strong>
												<p>Founded in 2003, Rovio achieved massive success with Angry Birds (2009), one of the most downloaded mobile games in history (over 4.5 billion downloads across platforms). The franchise expanded with sequels and spin-offs, including :</p>
												<p>
													<li>Angry Birds 2 – An improved version of the original game.</li>
													<li>Angry Birds Friends – A competitive version featuring online tournaments.</li>
													<li>Angry Birds Dream Blast – A puzzle game inspired by Candy Crush.</li>
												</p>
												<p>Rovio also ventured into animated movies, producing The Angry Birds Movie (2016), which grossed $352 million, followed by a sequel in 2019.</p>
												<p>In 2023, SEGA acquired Rovio for €706 million, aiming to strengthen its mobile gaming presence.</p>

												<h3>Sisu</h3>
												<p>Author: Bonneau Axel <br> Date: 31/03/2025</p>
											
												<p><strong>Sisu</strong></p>
												<p>In 1939 a myth raised. Finland was invaded by the URSS. 800 000 against 300 000. This war was not winnable and only the spark of hope fuelled the Finns spirit.
													During approximatively 100 days they fought a war that was deemed inhuman by the ONU and thus got the URSS banned from the organization. 
													This is the story of how “Sisu” became the description of Finnish people as people and as a country.</p>

												<p>This war was first initiated when in 1938 Stalin gain absolute power. He decided that Leningrad, (located at 32 km from the Finnish border) wasn’t safe. 
													After fierce negotiation where none of them were willing to compromise due to unreasonable demands from URSS and a trust issue from Finland, 
													the negotiation failed. The Finns where scared that the Soviet would step on their sovereignty while the soviets declared that the flank towards Leningrad 
													was in danger.</p>

												<p>The 26 of November 1939, 4 soviets died in an explosion at an outpost bordering Finland. Jumping to conclusion they declared war to Finland.
													 As of today, those death were actually due to a failed training exercise.</p>
											
												<p>The war broke-out and even outnumbered and pushed back again and again they never backed down. 
													Finland needed more soldier and thus a wave of propaganda started and Sisu emerged.</p>

												<p>Sisu is a very special word and doesn’t have any direct translation in any language. The closest thing to this world would be “never give up”,
													 “to have guts” or even the strength of will. Tou have to think of this world as mentality, where even pushed to the hardest one refuse to give up.
													  Be careful though, this world doesn’t mean to give at least give a try and then give up. It mean to try and try until,
													   whatever it takes, you achieve your goal. I actually found a very inspiring quote: “Sisu begins where hope ends”.</p>

												<p>If you would like to see what it means in action there is a very crude movie called “Sisu”  released in 2022 that’s is awesome and that actually
													 made write this article(beware, sensitive content).</p>

													During our February holiday, we decided to visit Rovaniemi. Rovaniemi is the capital of Lapland which is a region in the north of Finland. It is famous for its vast sub-Arctic wilderness, ski resorts and natural phenomena such as the midnight sun and the northern lights.</p>

												<p>To start our trip, we rented a car to give us a bit of freedom of movement but also an Airbnb (at approximately 1 hour of Rovaniemi with a car). Our Airbnb was lost in the middle of nowhere with just another house next to ours for only company. Our journey by car took 7 hours so we made a break at Oulu to eat and met a German friend. The first day, we went to Rovaniemi to visit Santa Claus village, it was a bit deceptive because even if we had the chance to take a photo with the “official” Santa Claus the village consisted mainly of gift shops. After that, we visited the Artikum, a museum with many expositions on the wildlife and natural phenomena in Lapland. We end the day by watching The Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the ring (the long version of course).</p>

												<p>On the second day, we made a walk to see impressive frozen waterfalls, on the way we saw some shelters where people can rest near a fire camp. And again, we end the day by watching The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. But the difference is that at the end of the movie, we received a notification on our phone telling us that if we went outside, we might see northern lights.  And indeed, we saw northern light, thanks to the nowhere position of our Airbnb there was no pollution of the city light. We spent a lot of time taking lots of photos.</p>
											
												<p>For the last day, we visited a zoo. We saw many animals from the artic circle like artic fox, reindeer and even wolf but unfortunately for us, the main attraction: the polar bear enclosure, was being refurbished. We headed back to Seinäjoki the same day.</p>

												<h3>The Moomins:</h3>
												<p>Author: Herbreteau Mathis <br> Date: 03/04/2025</p>
												<p>While the Belgians created the Smurfs, the British invented Winnie-the-Pooh, and the Americans gave life to Mickey Mouse, Finland has the Moomins.</p>

												<p>Created by the Finnish writer and illustrator Tove Jansson, the Moomins were at first characters that appeared in some books and comic in the 1940s. But since then, they have become a part of Finnish culture. We can follow their adventures in animated series, a lot of derivative products, and even theme parks.</p>
												
												<p>The Moomins are a family of round, white creatures that that look a little like a small hippopotamus, but they are in fact trolls. They live in a small house in Moominvalley and are known for their kind-hearted and adventurous nature. In the original story, a lot of characters are inspires of real people, mostly close relatives of the author, Tove Jansson. Each character embodies different aspects of human personality, making the stories both entertaining and meaningful.</p>

												<p>The Moomin books are exploring the themes of love, friendship, freedom, and the beauty of nature. Many of these themes were inspired by the life experiences of the author and the events she lived through while writing. This personal connection makes the Moomins not only popular among children but also appreciated by adults who recognize the deeper meanings in their adventures.</p>

												<p>In Finland, the Moomins are celebrated in many ways. One of the most famous places to experience the world of the Moomins is Moominworld, a theme park located in Naantali. This park brings the characters and their home to life like Disneyland do for example. You can find buildings, events and actors performing as Moomins in the park.</p>

												<p>Since this park is not quite close to Seinäjoki and is not quite fitted for our age, we didn’t consider visiting it. However, since the Moomins culture is widely spread, there are a lot of establishments that are themed around them. For example, we came across the Moomins Museum during our trip in Tampere in January. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the time to visit it during the timeframe we had, we already planned other activities. However, it is definitely a good place to visit for someone willing to discover more about Finnish culture.</p>
												
												<p>For visitors in Finland, exploring the world of the Moomins is a must and whether you want it or not, you will come across them in a certain way. Be it a deck of cards, a mug or even a statue. Moomins are really popular, and you will find them wherever you go. </p>

												<h3>Springtime in Finland:</h3>
												<p>Author: Pasquier Samuel <br> Date: 06/04/2025</p>
												<p>It’s been three months since we’ve arrived in Finland, and we had, during most of the time, snow ice and mostly cold temperatures. But we had, according to a lot of the Finnish people we talked to, a very warm winter. For example, we had temperature of minus 16 degree Celsius, to give a comparison the ESAIP Erasmus of last year had temperatures well below that, reaching minus 30 degrees Celsius and only had two weeks without snow everywhere. And for us the spring is there, since at least two weeks at the time of writing this.</p>


												<p>And now, the question you must ask is, how’s spring in Finland: well, it’s not very warm and still pretty cold at night, but you can expect temperatures between -5 and 10 degrees, it can still snow but it rarely rains. In the street of Seinajoki there is ice and snow on the sidewalk everywhere, and when it starts to melt, it can get slippery with water on ice. When the ice has all melted, the street is dirty underneath, with all the gravel they use to fight slipperiness on the road, and you can see a cleaning truck removing the dirt of the street. </p>

												<p>Finally, if you go on the walk on the countryside, you can see the nature beginning to wake up from the winter cold and the lack of sun. With the day beginning to get longer and the temperature going up, tree plant and animals are much more alive, grass that was under the ice can still be green, you can come across squirrel and other animal. The ice lakes aren't melting, and they will not for at least some time, the surrounding is more alive than before, and it is truly a delight to have a walk around.</p>

												<h3>An awkward silence?</h3>
												<p>Author: Bonneau Axel <br> Date: 18/04/2025</p>
										
												<p>France, in my opinion is a talkative, interactive and intimate country (relation wise). We like talking about variety of subject and when a huge silence occurred it 
													feel kind of awkward and we often try to fill it with random subject.</p>
										
												<p>But in Finland silence is approach a completely different way.</p>
												
												<p>As I said before in many cultures silence is quite uncomfortable whereas for Finns it is respected and feel comfortable. There is also the fact that they aren’t expecting
													 small talk and just stay silent are go directly for the point, no beating around the bush!</p>
												
												<p>At first, one could think Finns are distant and disrespectful but in fact it simply is respect. It’s a country where creating friendship can take a long time but it will 
													be a real friendship, one tha can last a long time. You might also notice that public spaces/transport or this type of places in general tend to be very quiet. 
													Because in Finland people talk fairly quietly or not at all…</p>
											
												<p>In some cases, peoples that talk a lot, who over-share or are too friendly too fast might seem fake and intrusive. That is why being reserved means being authentic in Finland.</p>
												
												<p>At the beginning of the years, we had a Finnish teacher that explained too us that when teaching abroad she was shocked by the kind of questions other teachers were asking her 
													such as family, salary, … What’s funny is also the fact that, when walking outside you can easily tell who is Finnish and who is not just by 
													listening to the amount of noises they are making.</p>
												
												<p>I could not say why Finland is such a quiet country, but it could probably come from how they use language. For example, saying how are you
													 in France is a form of greeting where in Finland it is a serious subject, and you will get a very serious answer about the person.</p>

												<p>Whatsoever being a quite place is all the better for me being a quiet person myself!</p>
