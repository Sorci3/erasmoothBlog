													<h3>Snow in Finland</h3>
													<p>Author : Le Pottier Mathias <br> Date : 19/01/2025</p>
													Before we start, a bit of background :<br>
													Finland is nordic country wich is famous for its winter landscapes and the snow play a crucial role in many of them. Due to the climate, snow cover Finland for a long period (it can be from november to april) and so much snow influence the culture, life style and activities of Finnish. <br>
													During the same period the daylight isn’t long (10am to 3pm) and even if the combination of the snow, the darkness and potential aurora borealis create a magical ambiance, the lack of sunlight affect the moral of everyone in a bad way.
													During winter, the average temperature is -15°C (even if, for the moment it’s warmer for us, more between -5°C and 4°C) so there is ice everywhere and it’s very slippy. The most of us are well equipped for the winter climate with technical footwear and thermal clothing but when there is wind you get cold very quickly.
													<br><img src="images/article/IMG20250108151845 - .jpg" alt=""/><br>
													Now, our main subject :<br>
													When we first arrive, we tried throwing snowballs at each other as any normal human would have done, the problem was that the snow was a little bit different than in France (when there is snow of course…), the snow was as hard as ice. It was so cold when we arrive that the snow was just pieces of ice… Our plan for a snowball fight has been compromised.
													Later, some of us managed to make a snowman (so you can made snowman even with icy snow, good to know I guess…), but this isn’t all, in Finland, snow means lots of activities like skiing, snowboarding or even snowmobile safaris. Of course there is also the famous activity where you go to the sauna and there you plunge into the water of a frozen lake.
													However, recent climate change is having an impact on snowfall in Finland. Winters are becoming milder, especially in the south, which is a major concern for the whole country.

													<h3>The lights of the night</h3>
													<p>Author : Herbreteau Mathis <br> Date : 20/01/2025</p>
													A cool thing to compare with your home country when you go to Finland, and you plan to live there 
													is the duration of the day. For example, in France, in January the average day duration is around 
													8 or 9 hours with a sunrise at around 8am and a sunset at around 5pm. These numbers change 
													throughout the year and are very different in each country. Here in Finland, in early January the 
													average day duration is 5 hours with a sunrise at around 10am and a sunset at around 3pm. It can 
													be very disturbing at first to go out at 3pm to visit the city and unfortunately its already the 
													night and you need to navigate in the city with lampposts light.
													<br>
													<br>
													When we talk about lamppost in Finland, it is not the most ecological invention they made, because 
													they just stay lighten up all the night. The main point to this is to protect the citizens, because 
													at night, the risks for drivers and pedestrians are much higher. With all the ice and the snow, people 
													need to see where they are walking or driving because the ground is very slippery, and it is verry easy 
													to fall. And as French people, we have already almost fallen multiple times in broad daylight, so we 
													don’t dislike having a little light at night. 
													<br>
													<br>
													The real problem with this is the light pollution. As you may know, Finland is known for its northern lights,
													 and unfortunately, if there is too much light, it is very hard if not impossible to see them. It also ruins 
													 the beauty of the night sky and can disrupt animals, insect and humans at night. Because yes, the use of 
													 artificial lights at night, can have an impact on the human circadian cycle. If you are exposed to too much 
													 light during the evening it can interfere with the body’s natural production of melatonin, the hormone that 
													 regulates sleep. This can make it harder to fall asleep, reduce sleep quality, and lead to fatigue during the 
													 day. Our first nights there were quite short, and it was really hard to sleep since thy don’t have blinds in 
													 Finland, they only have curtains. But we got used to it and everything is fine now !

													<h3>How to beat the cold</h3>
													<p>Author : Pasquier Samuel <br> Date : 20/01/2025</p>
													I am of course not telling you anything new if I tell you if it can be very cold in Finland. 
													At the time I’m writing this article, we didn’t have a temperature inferior to minus 16 degree Celsius, but we know from the former Erasmus from ESAIP that temperatures equal to minus 36 degrees are possible. 
													<br>
													<br>
													The problem we have is that we need to survive that. 
													We have to take inspiration from the Finnish people themselves: if you can stay inside, stay inside. 
													But if you need to go outside, the best way is to stack layer up, at least three: the first layer, close to the body, must be breathable, because you need to put the sweat away. 
													Why? Because if the sweat builds up and you stop generating heat from your body, like when you stop moving and it’s cold enough outside, ice can form and hurt you by attaching to your body. 
													For this layer you need something like thermal underwear or a polyester T-shirt without cotton. The second layer needs to be very hot to keep you warm and retain your body heat. You can wear something like a pullover, a fleece jacket or a long sleeve heavy duty shirt. 
													And finally for the outer layer need to protect you against the element, like the snow, the rain or the wind. 
													This is the base principle for all parts of your body, I’ve shown you the clothes you can use for the upper part of your body.
													<br>
													<br>
													It’s the same thing for the other parts of your body: for your legs, you wear thermal underwear then any sort of pants like joggings, blue jeans or velvet pants. 
													For your feet, you must double your socks and then use heavy duty shoes like boots. If there is ice outside, you can use cleats to avoid falling to your death on the ice. 
													The last thing you need to tackle before going outside is the extremity of your body like your hand or your head. For the hand, you can double your glove or use mitten. 
													Finally, for your head, use a hood, a beanie or even a neck warmer.

												<h3>Small details that make Finland unique</h3>
												<p>Author: Martinat Julien <br> Date: 20/01/2025</p>
											
												<h4>1. Bull Bars on Cars</h4>
												<p>At the front of many cars, I noticed something at the front that is unusual. These are not just aesthetic features or engine heaters but protections, sometimes referred to as bull bars, but it is for daily life cars. They also have some headlights attached to it. They are designed to shield vehicles from impacts, particularly collisions with wildlife animals.</p>
												<img src="images/uniquethings/car.png" alt="Car with bull bars" />
											
												<h4>2. Respect for Pedestrians</h4>
												<p>Crossing a pedestrian walkway in Finland is a nice experience for many visitors. Finnish drivers are very polite and stop quickly when they see someone who wants to cross the road. Respect for pedestrians is an important part of Finnish culture.</p>
												<img src="images/uniquethings/redlight.png" alt="Pedestrian walkway" />
											
												<h4>3. No Shutters, Only Blinds</h4>
												<p>For people used to windows with shutters, it can feel strange that there are none in Finland compared to France. Finnish homes usually have light blinds, but they don’t completely block the light. This is because people in Finland like to use as much natural light as possible since it is very important in this country that has long and dark winters.</p>
												<img src="images/uniquethings/volets.png" alt="Window with blinds" />
											
												<h4>4. Bottle Deposit System</h4>
												<p>Whenever you pay a plastic bottle or can, there is a fee on it added on your bill depending on what you’ve bought. Finland has a recycling system where every bottle or can comes with a deposit: €0.40 for a bottle and €0.15 for a can. This system encourages recycling and makes Finland a leader in waste management. After recycling the bottles or cans at the machine near a mall, you can use the coupons given by the machine to buy new things in the mall.</p>

												<h3>Urbex in Seinäjoki</h3>
												<p>Author: Martinat Julien <br> Date: 20/01/2025</p>
											
												<p style="margin: 0;">Since Urbex (Urban exploration) is one of my biggest passions, I wanted to share a place I found even before arriving at Seinäjoki. All I know is that this place was an educational institution named Sedu, it has been abandoned between 2018 and 2022 from what I can say. This place is near the Seinäjoki Hospital and took me nearly 4 hours to explore entirely. What I found here was mind-blowing: 2 bunkers, a swimming pool, a gymnasium, classrooms, an air ventilation system, a cafeteria, 2 amphitheaters, a dental room with a chair, student apartments, a server room, and much more …</p>
